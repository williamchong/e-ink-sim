# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature is a Chrome extension designed specifically for web developers to test and optimize their web applications for e-ink devices. The extension provides accurate e-ink display simulation, debugging tools, and performance analysis to help developers create e-ink-friendly web experiences without requiring physical e-ink hardware. The extension includes developer-focused controls and metrics similar to browser DevTools but specialized for e-ink development.

5. WHEN animations or transitions are detected THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and suggestions for e-ink optimization
6. WHEN the developer tests interactive elements THEN the system SHALL simulate e-ink response delays and visual feedback
7. WHEN the developer previews different e-ink device types THEN the system SHALL offer presets for common e-ink readers (Kindle, Kobo, reMarkable)
8. IF the developer navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain simulation settings and continue monitoring e-ink compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to test my application against different e-ink device profiles and settings, so that I can ensure compatibility across various e-ink hardware configurations.

4. WHEN the developer modifies contrast and brightness THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview with precise controls
5. WHEN the developer configures color settings THEN the system SHALL offer grayscale depth options (1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit) matching real hardware
6. WHEN the developer sets scrolling behavior THEN the system SHALL provide speed and smoothness controls with e-ink appropriate constraints
7. WHEN the developer enables ghosting effects THEN the system SHALL offer intensity and duration controls based on actual e-ink behavior
8. WHEN the developer configures animation overrides THEN the system SHALL provide granular controls for different animation types
9. WHEN the developer selects device presets THEN the system SHALL offer Kindle, Kobo, reMarkable, and custom hardware profiles
10. IF the developer wants to reset settings THEN the system SHALL provide one-click restore to default testing configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to analyze how my web application performs across different content types and layouts on e-ink displays, so that I can optimize for various use cases and content structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer tests text-heavy content THEN the system SHALL analyze readability and provide typography optimization suggestions
2. WHEN the developer tests image-heavy layouts THEN the system SHALL show dithering effects and recommend image optimization strategies
3. WHEN the developer tests interactive elements THEN the system SHALL evaluate touch targets and interaction patterns for e-ink usability
4. WHEN the developer tests dynamic content THEN the system SHALL measure refresh impact and suggest optimization approaches
5. WHEN the developer tests different layout patterns THEN the system SHALL provide performance comparisons and recommendations
6. IF the developer tests responsive designs THEN the system SHALL simulate various e-ink device screen sizes and orientations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want accurate e-ink hardware simulation with measurable performance metrics, so that I can make data-driven decisions about e-ink optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN e-ink simulation is active THEN the system SHALL limit refresh rate to simulate e-ink display constraints (1-15 Hz)
2. WHEN the developer tests scrolling THEN the system SHALL reduce scroll speed to mimic e-ink refresh limitations
3. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply resolution limitations typical of e-ink displays
4. WHEN processing colors THEN the system SHALL convert to black and white or limited grayscale palette matching target hardware
5. WHEN animations are present THEN the system SHALL replace smooth transitions with stepped or eliminated animations
6. WHEN page updates occur THEN the system SHALL simulate ghosting effects typical of e-ink displays
7. WHEN text is rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize font rendering for e-ink readability (increase contrast, adjust anti-aliasing)
8. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL apply dithering algorithms to simulate e-ink image rendering
9. WHEN the display refreshes THEN the system SHALL simulate the brief flash/inversion that occurs on e-ink screens
10. IF the developer measures performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on refresh rates, battery impact, and rendering efficiency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the extension to override JavaScript APIs that affect display performance, so that web applications behave authentically like they would on e-ink hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN e-ink simulation is active THEN the system SHALL override requestAnimationFrame to limit frame rates to e-ink appropriate speeds
2. WHEN video elements are present THEN the system SHALL reduce video frame rates to simulate e-ink video playback limitations
3. WHEN JavaScript animations are detected THEN the system SHALL intercept and modify timing functions to match e-ink refresh rates
4. WHEN scroll events occur THEN the system SHALL override scroll behavior to simulate e-ink scrolling constraints
5. WHEN CSS animations run THEN the system SHALL modify animation durations and easing functions for e-ink compatibility
6. WHEN setTimeout/setInterval are used for animations THEN the system SHALL adjust timing to match e-ink refresh capabilities
7. IF WebGL or Canvas animations are present THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable or significantly slow them down

### Requirement 6
