# E-ink Simulator Extension

A Chrome extension that helps web developers test and optimize their applications for e-ink devices by providing accurate e-ink display simulation directly in the browser.

## Core Purpose

The extension simulates e-ink device characteristics including:
- Grayscale conversion with device-specific contrast adjustments
- Frame rate limiting (1-15 Hz) to match e-ink refresh constraints
- Scroll flash effects that mimic e-ink screen refreshes
- Image dithering using Floyd-Steinberg algorithm
- Video optimization with reduced playback rates
- Device profiles for popular e-ink devices (Kindle, Kobo, reMarkable)

## Target Users

Web developers building:
- Reading applications
- Documentation sites
- E-book platforms
- Note-taking applications
- Any web content intended for e-ink devices

## Key Features

- One-click simulation toggle
- Device-specific profiles with realistic settings
- Performance metrics and debugging tools
- Cross-tab independent simulation settings
- Comprehensive options interface
- Debug console methods for testing
