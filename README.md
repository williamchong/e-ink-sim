### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All code must be type-safe
- **ESLint**: Follow the configured linting rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is enforced
- **Testing**: Include tests for new features

### Areas for Contribution

- Additional device profiles
- Enhanced visual effects
- Performance optimizations

- Bug fixes and stability improvements

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support (Manifest V3) - All features implemented and tested
- **Edge**: Full support (Chromium-based) - Compatible with Chrome implementation
- **Firefox**: Planned (requires Manifest V2 compatibility layer)
- **Safari**: Under consideration (requires Safari Web Extensions conversion)

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

- **Cross-origin Content**: Limited control over iframe content from different domains
- **Native Scrolling**: Cannot override touch scrolling physics on mobile devices  
- **Video Frame Rate**: Cannot directly control video decoding frame rates (uses playback rate instead)
- **Hardware Refresh**: Cannot control actual monitor refresh rates
- **CSP Restrictions**: Some websites with strict Content Security Policies may limit functionality

### Workarounds

- **CSP Restrictions**: World script injection via service worker bypasses most CSP limitations
- **API Failures**: Graceful fallbacks to CSS-only simulation when JavaScript overrides fail
- **Lazy Loading**: Multi-strategy detection handles various lazy loading implementations
- **Performance**: Optimized for development use with minimal overhead (~2-5% CPU usage)

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: Minimal impact (~5MB additional memory usage)
- **CPU**: Low overhead during simulation (~2-5% CPU usage)
- **Battery**: Negligible impact on laptop battery life

### Optimization Tips

- Disable simulation when not actively testing
- Use device profiles appropriate for your target hardware
- Test on representative content and user flows

## Privacy and Security

- **No Data Collection**: Extension does not collect or transmit user data
- **Local Storage Only**: All settings stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- **No External Requests**: Extension operates entirely offline
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for security review
